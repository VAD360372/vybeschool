What exactly is VybeClub?

VybeClub is an on-campus student community powered by VybeSchool.

It operates within colleges and is designed to help students:

Learn AI and future skills through practical application

Work on real-world projects and gig opportunities

Explore startups, freelancing, and early career pathways

Connect with mentors, founders, and industry professionals

VybeClub is not a coaching institute and not a placement agency.
It is a learning and opportunity ecosystem, built by students, for students.

Who is VybeClub for?

VybeClub activities are open to all students in the college.

Workshops, events, talks, hackathons, and festivals are accessible to everyone on campus.

However, leadership roles, core projects, internships, and internal opportunities are reserved for official VybeClub members, selected through a structured, merit-based process.
